Awesome Rules with multiple lines!

Yep, really!
And a fancy listing with numbers:
1.) You do not talk about the fightclub
2.) You do not talkt abouth the fightclub
3.) You really don't talk about the fightclub!

So much text that I can't help myself but think:


WHYWHYHWHY!!??!??!?!?

Do you really need that many rules for a MP-game? What kind of players do you think will join your server? That's just insane, dude! Don't you think?
Anyway, I think I will leave it with that for now, let's just see, how the text behaves in the modal dialog window that is shipped with the mod CoxisServerMessage.
Hopefully it will all fit in there, or atleast creates a scrollbar for the user.


That's it for now, bye!
